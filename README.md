# Path Planner
   
### Goals

The goal of this project is to build a path planner that creates smooth, safe trajectories for the car to follow. The highway track has other vehicles, all going different speeds, but approximately obeying the 50 MPH speed limit. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

The car transmits its location, along with its sensor fusion data, which estimates the location of all the vehicles on the same side of the road.

The path planner outputs a list of x and y global map coordinates. Each pair of x and y coordinates is a point, and all of the points together form a trajectory. 

Every 20 ms the car moves to the next point on the list. The car's new rotation becomes the line between the previous waypoint and the car's new location.

The car moves from point to point perfectly, so there is no controller in this project.

The velocity of the car depends on the spacing of the points. Because the car moves to a new waypoint every 20ms, the larger the spacing between points, the faster the car will travel. The speed goal is to have the car traveling at (but not above) the 50 MPH speed limit as often as possible.

### Highway Map

Inside data/highway_map.csv there is a list of waypoints that go all the way around the track. The track contains a total of 181 waypoints, with the last waypoint mapping back around to the first. The waypoints are in the middle of the double-yellow dividing line in the center of the highway.

The track is 6945.554 meters around (about 4.32 miles). If the car averages near 50 MPH, then it should take a little more than 5 minutes for it to go all the way around the highway.

The highway has 6 lanes total - 3 heading in each direction. Each lane is 4 m wide and the car should only ever be in one of the 3 lanes on the right-hand side. The car should always be inside a lane unless doing a lane change.

### Waypoint Data

Each waypoint has an (x,y) global map position, and a Frenet s value and Frenet d unit normal vector (split up into the x component, and the y component).

The s value is the distance along the direction of the road. The first waypoint has an s value of 0 because it is the starting point.

The d vector has a magnitude of 1 and points perpendicular to the road in the direction of the right-hand side of the road. The d vector can be used to calculate lane positions. For example, if you want to be in the left lane at some waypoint just add the waypoint's (x,y) coordinates with the d vector multiplied by 2. Since the lane is 4 m wide, the middle of the left lane (the lane closest to the double-yellow dividing line) is 2 m from the waypoint.

If you would like to be in the middle lane, add the waypoint's coordinates to the d vector multiplied by 6 = (2+4), since the center of the middle lane is 4 m from the center of the left lane, which is itself 2 m from the double-yellow dividing line and the waypoints.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Trajectory Generation

To generate valid trajectories - sensor fusion was fed into a state manager to determine the appropriate action for the car. There were three main states fed into the state manager:

1. Is there a car ahead and is my car getting to close
2. Is there a car to my left on the same side of the road blocking me from turning
3. Is there a car to my right on the same side of the road blocking me from turning

Based on each of these lane flags for the state manager the car would either turn left if it was getting to close to the car in front of it, turn right, or slow down. If the car was not too close it would speed up if going below the 50 mph by the maximum allowable accelerationi.

To define a path a spline was used which calculated how to break up the spline points to travel at the desired reference velocity. To create smooth trajectories the following spline library was used: http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/. 

This implementation allowed the car to travel around the track without any accidents!
